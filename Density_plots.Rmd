Using the r package `overlap` following the approach described in Gaynor et al. 2018, Effects of human settlement and roads on diel activity patterns of elephants (Loxodonta africana). African Journal of Ecology 56:872-881.

Set things up:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
library(tidyverse)
library(overlap)
library(lubridate)
```

Pull in some data
```{r}
DF<-read.csv("./Data/Activity.csv")
```
Convert times to radians as required by package:

```{r}
DF<-DF %>% mutate(
  Hour_ratio = Hour/24,
  Hour_rat_rad = Hour_ratio*2*pi,
  Hour_rad= Hour*2*pi
)

summary(DF$Hour_rad)
summary(DF$Hour_ratio)
```
Now extract the times and get rid of na's
```{r}
Times<-DF$Hour_rat_rad
Times<-na.omit(Times)
Times<-as.numeric(Times)
```

Now make a density plot

```{r}
densityPlot(Times)
```
